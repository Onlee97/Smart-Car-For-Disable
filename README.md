# Smart Car for Severely Paralyzed Patients

## Inspiration
Patients suffering from severe paralysis are usually dependent on other people’s assistance to move around their house and outdoor. Our team creates a software application to help these people navigate indoor and outdoor environments without much assistance from other people. We’re using computer-vision-based eye-tracking and IMU-based head pose estimation to receive commands from the user to control the car. 

The system also has another feature that allows the user to seeks help from people around when running into difficulty when moving around.
